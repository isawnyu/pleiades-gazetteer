# repackage code for Atom export

From [the Pleiades 3 proposal narrative](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf), page 4:

> To enhance the performance of the Pleiades API, we will also repackage and extend the code that produces the five different serialization formats we provide for each place record: KML (for Google Earth), **Atom (for feed readers and web syndication),** the two most common syntaxes of the LOD-oriented Resource Description Framework (RDF+XML and Turtle), and GeoJSON (a format for exchanging spatial data with external web applications). Note: Keyhole Markup Language (KML): LOC Formats, KML. Note: Atom Syndication Format: Nottingham 2005.

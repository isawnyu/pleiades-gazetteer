#new GUI

From [the Pleiades 3 proposal narrative](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf), page 4:

> We will deploy a new interface for our human users that makes no additional demands on the database or Plone infrastructure by adapting open-source code already written by the Duke Classics Collaboratory (DC3) and extending it with full-featured maps and responsive styling for tablet and mobile systems. The DC3 code uses the Pleiades GeoJSON format and already boasts a fast, innovative place name search function that runs entirely in each user’s browser. Note: DC3’s “Pleiades Static Search” can be used online at https://ryanfb.github.io/pleiades-static-search/ and has been released under open license at https://github.com/ryanfb/pleiades-static-search.

#faceted search with Solr

From [the Pleiades 3 proposal narrative](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf), page 4:

> We will supplement both the API and the new user interface with server-based faceted search capabilities underpinned by the high-performance Apache Solr search engine. Faceted search will enable more advanced users to find content quickly by incrementally filtering their search results using attributes other than name (e.g., type, date, and spatial location). Note: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/. Faceted search and its implementation is well explained in Seeley 2009.

# user focus sessions

From [the Pleiades 3 proposal narrative](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf), page 9:

> We will also conduct three user focus sessions during which a group of 8-10 current and prospective Pleiades users will spend a day before or after a major conference talking over successes and challenges, evaluating the effects of recent software changes, and setting priorities for the next round of development. The PI, in consultation with the Editorial College, will identify and recruit these individuals in advance of the events. During the events, we will identify “champions” for particular issues or upgrades whom we will consult subsequently for more feedback as relevant improvements are made. These individuals will also be asked to provide written input to the final report and white paper. Priorities, use cases, and other actionable information arising from these meetings will be documented in performance reporting and on the Pleiades blog in the interest of transparency and by way of example.

> The three conferences we have identified for focus meetings are: the Joint Annual Meetings of the Society for Classical Studies and the Archaeological Institute of America (SCS/AIA; January 2016, San Francisco); the Annual Meeting of the Association of Ancient Historians (AAH; May 2016, Tacoma, Washington); and SCS/AIA (January 2017, Toronto, Canada). The PI, in consultation with the Editorial College and Pleiades partners, may elect to hold the third user focus event at another venue such as the annual meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research or the annual Byzantine Studies Conference.

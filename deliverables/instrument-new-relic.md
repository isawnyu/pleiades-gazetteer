#instrument plone with new relic

From [the Pleiades 3 proposal narrative](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf), pages 4-5:

> We will also gain the ability to equip the system with performance-monitoring capabilities provided by the New Relic application analytics platform by adding and configuring a plugin that is already widely used in the Plone community. The New Relic service will enable us to identify the most time-consuming operations remaining following the upgrade so that we can introduce targeted improvements to remedy them. Note: https://newrelic.com/. Plone plugin: https://github.com/collective/collective.newrelic.

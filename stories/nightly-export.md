# performance upgrade: repackage nightly CSV export code and make it comprehensive

From [the Pleiades 3 proposal narrative](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf), page 4:

> We will continue to use the well-known and easily parsed Comma-Separated Value (CSV) format for nightly export of content from Pleiades, but extract the code that creates it from Plone so that we can make it reflect comprehensively the contents of the database without negative impact on web performance. ([See LOC Formats, CSV](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml). Metadata and access to the Pleiades dump files: http://pleiades.stoa.org/downloads.)

## Pleiades 3
At the beginning of August 2015, the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov) announced the award of a $322,615 grant for major upgrades and improvements to the *Pâ€‹leiades* gazetteer of ancient places. More information about the award is available [on the ISAW News Blog](http://isaw.nyu.edu/news/pleiades-grant-2015). A copy of the proposal narrative has been [posted online in PDF format](http://pleiades.stoa.org/files/pleiades-3-2015/proposal.pdf). Tickets (issues) related to the grant-funded work are kept in the main issue tracker on this repository; [they are labeled "p3"](https://github.com/isawnyu/pleiades-gazetteer/labels/p3). Other documents related to the *Pleiades* 3 effort may be found in [the pleiades3 branch of this repository](https://github.com/isawnyu/pleiades-gazetteer/tree/pleiades3).
